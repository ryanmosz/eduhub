# Security Checklist Before GitHub Push

## ‚úÖ Environment Files
- [x] `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (both root and frontend)
- [x] Only `.env.example` and `.env.production.example` files are tracked
- [x] No actual secrets in example files

## ‚úÖ Auth0 Credentials
The following Auth0 credentials appear in the codebase:
- Domain: `dev-1fx6yhxxi543ipno.us.auth0.com`
- Client ID: `s05QngyZXEI3XNdirmJu0CscW1hNgaRD`

**Status**: These are development/demo credentials that are already public (from the Auth0 documentation).
They are safe to commit as they're for a demo application.

## ‚úÖ Hardcoded Values Review
- Mock Plone token: `mock-plone-token-12345` - This is a mock value for testing
- Default passwords: All use "admin" which is clearly for demo purposes
- No private keys or real secrets found

## ‚úÖ Safe to Commit Files
The following files contain Auth0 demo credentials but are safe:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Documentation
- `render.yaml` - Uses environment variable references
- `src/eduhub/auth/dependencies.py` - Has fallback to demo values
- `src/eduhub/auth/oauth.py` - Has fallback to demo values
- Model examples in `src/eduhub/auth/models.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders
1. **Before Production**: Replace all Auth0 credentials with production values
2. **Use Environment Variables**: All sensitive values should come from environment
3. **Never Commit**: Real `.env` files, private keys, or production secrets

## üîí Security Best Practices Implemented
1. All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
2. `.env` files are gitignored
3. Example files contain only placeholder values
4. No hardcoded production secrets
5. Auth fallbacks use public demo credentials

## ‚úÖ Final Check
- [x] No `.env` files will be committed
- [x] No private keys in codebase
- [x] No production secrets in codebase
- [x] Auth0 demo credentials are intentional and safe
- [x] All passwords are clearly demo values ("admin", "password")

**Status: SAFE TO PUSH TO GITHUB** ‚úÖ
