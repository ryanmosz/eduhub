### Notes

1. Each phase below has received its own `tasks/tasks-phase-X-*.md` document with expanded parent/sub-tasks.
2. Features correspond to refined *Option A* selection based on weekend MVP timeline and user value analysis.
3. "âœ…" indicates a phase completed; "[x]" indicates fully implemented and tested.
4. **Strategic Context**: See `tasks-overall-project-plan-addendum.md` for detailed implementation strategy, testing methodology, and GUI approach decisions.
5. **Feature Prioritization**: Phases 3-8 are core MVP features (6 required to pass). Phases 9-12 are conditional enhancements based on available time.

## ðŸ“Š **PROJECT STATISTICS AFTER RECOVERY**

**Recovered Production Code:**

- **Phase VI**: 1,906 lines + 32KB tests/docs (Open Data API)
- **Phase VII**: 4,203 lines + 75KB tests/docs (Workflow Templates)
- **Total Recovered**: ~6,000+ lines of production-ready code

**Combined Project Scope:**

- **Development Phases**: 8 core phases completed
- **Production Code**: ~15,000+ lines across all modules
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites for all phases
- **Documentation**: Full API docs, user guides, architecture

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL RECOVERY NOTES**

**Major Discovery**: Both Phase VI and VII were **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** but mysteriously deleted:

- Phase VI: Found in orphaned commit `d8b9fd0`
- Phase VII: Found in orphaned commit `2fc2852`
- Both phases had production-ready code, comprehensive tests, and documentation
- Recovery completed successfully - all code restored to working branch

**Project Timeline Impact**:

- Project was actually **87.5% complete** before deletion incident
- Only Phase VIII and post-core phases remain for MVP
- Recovery adds significant value to project scope
