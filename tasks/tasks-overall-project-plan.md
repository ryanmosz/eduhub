- Phase VII: Found in orphaned commit `2fc2852`
- Both phases had production-ready code, comprehensive tests, and documentation
- Recovery completed successfully - all code restored to working branch

- Project was actually **87.5% complete** before deletion incident
- Only Phase VIII and post-core phases remain for MVP
- Recovery adds significant value to project scope
