### Notes

- Keep code and tests colocated where sensible (e.g. `hello.py` and `test_hello.py`).
- Run `pytest -q` locally to execute the test suite.
- CI should run against Python 3.11 and 3.9, matching the upgrade harness plan.
- Development environment uses Docker Compose for consistent local setup.
- Project follows modern Python packaging standards with pyproject.toml.
- Virtual environment created with Python 3.13 and core dependencies installed.
- FastAPI application successfully demonstrates async capabilities and modern Python features.
- All code passes black and isort formatting checks.
- Plone bootstrap provides the legacy CMS foundation that EduHub will modernize.
- Plone buildout completed successfully with 340+ packages installed.
- Socket path issue is expected in deep directories; use foreground mode for testing.
- Integration bridge provides modern REST API access to legacy Plone content.
- PloneClient handles authentication, CRUD operations, and async HTTP communication.
- FastAPI endpoints (/content/, /plone/info) expose Plone data via modern JSON API.
- CI pipeline includes linting (black, isort, mypy), testing (Python 3.9/3.11), coverage (60%+), security scanning, Docker build/test, and quality gates.
- Quality gates enforce core requirements (lint, test, integration, build) and optional checks (security, Docker) with proper failure handling.
