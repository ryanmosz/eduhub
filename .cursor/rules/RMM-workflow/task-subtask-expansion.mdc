# Task Subtask Expansion Process

## Overview

When given a task file with existing parent tasks, the goal is to add detailed subtasks underneath each parent task while preserving the original parent task structure exactly as written.

## Process Steps

1. **Identify the Target File**: User will specify the exact task file that contains parent tasks needing subtask expansion.

2. **Preserve Parent Tasks**: Keep all parent task titles and descriptions exactly as they are written. Do NOT modify, rewrite, or restructure the parent tasks.

3. **Add Subtasks**: Under each parent task, add numbered subtasks using the format:
   - Parent task: `2.1 Branch & Environment Setup`
   - Subtasks: `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`, etc.

4. **Subtask Numbering**: Follow the existing parent task numbering scheme and add decimal subtasks:
   - If parent is `2.1`, subtasks are `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.1.3`...
   - If parent is `3.4`, subtasks are `3.4.1`, `3.4.2`, `3.4.3`...

5. **Subtask Detail Level**: Each subtask should be:
   - Actionable and specific
   - Completable in a reasonable timeframe  
   - Clear enough for a junior developer to understand
   - Focused on a single logical step

6. **Edit Existing File**: Modify the existing file that contains the parent tasks. Do NOT create a new file unless explicitly instructed.

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do NOT create new files instead of editing the existing one
- ❌ Do NOT modify parent task titles or descriptions
- ❌ Do NOT reorganize or restructure the parent tasks
- ❌ Do NOT change the numbering scheme of parent tasks
- ❌ Do NOT assume - ask for clarification if the target file is unclear

## Expected Outcome

The result should be the same file with:
- All original parent tasks preserved exactly as written
- Detailed subtasks added under each parent
- Clear progression from parent completion → phase completion
- Ready for execution following the task-execution-workflow.mdc

## Example Structure

```markdown
- [ ] **2.1 Branch & Environment Setup**
  - Original parent task description remains unchanged
  - [ ] 2.1.1 Specific actionable subtask
  - [ ] 2.1.2 Another specific actionable subtask
  - [ ] 2.1.3 Final subtask to complete 2.1

- [ ] **2.2 Next Parent Task**
  - Original parent task description remains unchanged  
  - [ ] 2.2.1 First subtask for this parent
  - [ ] 2.2.2 Second subtask for this parent
```

This process ensures task lists are detailed enough for execution while maintaining the user's original planning structure.
