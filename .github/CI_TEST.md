# CI Pipeline Test

This file was created to test the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

## Test Information
- **Created**: 2025-07-24 22:20:47 UTC
- **Purpose**: Validate CI/CD pipeline functionality
- **Pipeline Features Tested**:
  - Code quality checks (Black, isort, MyPy)
  - Unit tests with coverage (Python 3.9, 3.11)
  - Integration tests (Plone-FastAPI)
  - Security scanning (Safety, Bandit)
  - Docker build and container testing
  - Quality gates evaluation

## Expected Results
- ✅ All core quality gates should pass
- ✅ Coverage should be 60%+ (currently ~63%)
- ⚠️ Security and Docker gates may show warnings (acceptable)
- ✅ Quality gates should evaluate correctly

## Cleanup
This file can be removed after successful CI validation.



## CI Test Validation - 2025-07-24 22:22:06 UTC

This commit validates our CI/CD pipeline functionality.

### Expected Pipeline Behavior:
1. **Lint Job**: ✅ Should pass (Black, isort, MyPy)
2. **Test Job**: ✅ Should pass (63% coverage > 60% threshold)
3. **Integration Job**: ✅ Should pass (Plone-FastAPI bridge)
4. **Security Job**: ⚠️ May show warnings (acceptable)
5. **Docker Job**: ⚠️ May fail without Docker Hub secrets (acceptable)
6. **Build Job**: ✅ Should pass (Python package)
7. **Quality Gates**: ✅ Should pass (core gates succeed)

This test validates the entire CI/CD workflow is operational.
